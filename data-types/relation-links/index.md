## Prevalue Editor Settings

Configuration is simply a matter of selecting a Relation Type.
As of v6, two additional configuration options were added, the first to select a rendering direction (Horizontal or Vertical) and
the other to specify an optional macro that can be used for templating each rendered item.

## Content Editor

The configured Relation Type is queried using the id of the current node / media / member and any related nodes / media or members are rendered as a list of links


## External Links

For a walkthrough on how to use Relation Links in combination with the built-in Picker Relations datatype see : [Who Picked This ?](http://24days.in/umbraco/2012/who-picked-this/).
